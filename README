Welcome to blfs-builder!

The purpose of blfs-builder is to generate and execute build scripts 
for the Beyond Linux from Scratch book.

https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/

blfs-builder utilizes three stages to accomplish this:

1) init
2) select
3) build

Each will be covered in some detail below

====================================================================

make init
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This stage initializes the base parameters of the build including
book version and revision. It performs the following steps:

1) clone blfs book from git repository
2) checkout book versions specified in configuration
3) generate full book xml for configured rev (sysv, systemd)
4) generate full dependencie tree
5) generate full build script set


make select
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This stage selects the packages to be built. It performs the 
following steps:

1) generate dependency tree for selected packages
2) create ordered build script repository
3) build Makefile for selected builds scripts


make build
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This stage executes the build scripts.
